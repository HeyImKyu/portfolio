        <p>Hey, I'm Kyu! 💕</p>
        <p>I'm a 24-year-old full-stack developer from Germany who loves to play around with new technologies and aquire new skills ✨</p>

        <h1 class="category">Things I know</h1>

        <p>I've played around with many programming languages and tech-stacks but I'm most proficient in C#, using EntityFramework as a database mapper and Angular as a frontend framework.</p>
        <p>In my free time i currently do a lot in linux — specifically NixOs — as I currently use it as a daily driver on my laptop. <img src="{{ "/assets/lenix.png" | url }}" class="emoji"></img></p>
        <p>Other than that i host a little proxmox server with lots of virtual machines and lxc containers that i use to host services i love and try out new things that i find fascinating!</p>

        <h1 class="category">Things I do</h1>

        <p>I'm currently working on a lot of projects which you can see on this website 🛠️</p>

        <p>
            You can also see my <a class="link" href="https://github.com/HeyImKyu">GitHub profile</a> or my own <a class="link" href="https://git.kyuti.es/HeyImKyu">Forgejo instance</a> but many of my
            projects are private, so it might be a bit underwhelming :(
        </p>

        <h1 class=" category">Things I love</h1>

        <p>
            When I got bored, I like to play cozy story / puzzle games like <a class="link" href="https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/outer-wilds.html">Outer Wilds</a>,
            <a class="link" href="https://rawfury.com/games/sable/">Sable</a> or
            <a class="link" href="https://dont-nod.com/en/games/life-is-strange/">Life is Strange</a> 🎮
            (Although i rarely get the chance to play games recently ;-;)
        </p>

        <p>
            I love meeting and talking to new people, be it at university which i visit in my free time, local queer groups i join weekly, or even online in VRChat on the weekends.
            Every person has interesting stories to tell and i love listening to all of them ✨
        </p>

        <p>
            The most important thing for me is that <a class="bold-text">everyone</a> belongs, <a class="bold-text">everyone</a> feels welcome and <a class="bold-text">everybody's</a> voice is heard 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
        </p>
